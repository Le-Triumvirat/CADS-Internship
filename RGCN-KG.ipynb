    "# A brief introduction to R-GCN\n",
    "# ---------------------------\n",
    "# In *statistical relational learning* (SRL), there are two fundamental\n",
    "# tasks:\n",
    "#\n",
    "# - **Entity classification** - Where you assign types and categorical\n",
    "#   properties to entities.\n",
    "# - **Link prediction** - Where you recover missing triples.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# In both cases, missing information is expected to be recovered from the \n",
    "# neighborhood structure of the graph. For example, the R-GCN\n",
    "# paper cited earlier provides the following example. Knowing that Mikhail Baryshnikov was educated at the Vaganova Academy\n",
    "# implies both that Mikhail Baryshnikov should have the label person, and\n",
    "# that the triple (Mikhail Baryshnikov, lived in, Russia) must belong to the\n",
    "# knowledge graph.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# R-GCN solves these two problems using a common graph convolutional network. It's \n",
    "# extended with multi-edge encoding to compute embedding of the entities, but\n",
    "# with different downstream processing.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# - Entity classification is done by attaching a softmax classifier at the\n",
    "#   final embedding of an entity (node). Training is through loss of standard\n",
    "#   cross-entropy.\n",
    "# - Link prediction is done by reconstructing an edge with an autoencoder\n",
    "#   architecture, using a parameterized score function. Training uses negative\n",
    "#   sampling.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# This tutorial focuses on the first task, entity classification, to show how to generate entity\n",
    "# representation. `Complete\n",
    "# code <https://github.com/dmlc/dgl/tree/rgcn/examples/pytorch/rgcn>`_\n",
    "# for both tasks is found in the DGL Github repository.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Key ideas of R-GCN\n",
    "# -------------------\n",
    "# Recall that in GCN, the hidden representation for each node[i] :math:`i` at\n",
    "# :math:`(l+1)^{th}` [l+1^th]layer is computed by:\n",
    "#\n",
    "# .. math:: h_i^{l+1} = \\sigma\\left(\\sum_{j\\in N_i}\\frac{1}{c_i} W^{(l)} h_j^{(l)}\\right)~~~~~~~~~~(1)\\\\\n",
    "#\n",
    "# where :math:`c_i` is a normalization constant.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# The key difference between R-GCN and GCN is that in R-GCN, edges can\n",
    "# represent different relations. In GCN, weight :math:`W^{(l)}` in equation\n",
    "# :math:`(1)` is shared by all edges in layer :math:`l`. In contrast, in\n",
    "# R-GCN, different edge types use different weights and only edges of the\n",
    "# same relation type :math:`r` are associated with the same projection weight\n",
    "# :math:`W_r^{(l)}`.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# So the hidden representation of entities in :math:`(l+1)^{th}` layer in\n",
    "# R-GCN can be formulated as the following equation:\n",
    "#\n",
    "# .. math:: h_i^{l+1} = \\sigma\\left(W_0^{(l)}h_i^{(l)}+\\sum_{r\\in R}\\sum_{j\\in N_i^r}\\frac{1}{c_{i,r}}W_r^{(l)}h_j^{(l)}\\right)~~~~~~~~~~(2)\\\\\n",
    "#\n",
    "# where :math:`N_i^r` denotes the set of neighbor indices of node :math:`i`\n",
    "# under relation :math:`r\\in R` and :math:`c_{i,r}` is a normalization\n",
    "# constant. In entity classification, the R-GCN paper uses\n",
    "# :math:`c_{i,r}=|N_i^r|`.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# The problem of applying the above equation directly is the rapid growth of\n",
    "# the number of parameters, especially with highly multi-relational data. In\n",
    "# order to reduce model parameter size and prevent overfitting, the original\n",
    "# paper proposes to use basis decomposition.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# .. math:: W_r^{(l)}=\\sum\\limits_{b=1}^B a_{rb}^{(l)}V_b^{(l)}~~~~~~~~~~(3)\\\\\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Therefore, the weight :math:`W_r^{(l)}` is a linear combination of basis\n",
    "# transformation :math:`V_b^{(l)}` with coefficients :math:`a_{rb}^{(l)}`.\n",
    "# The number of bases :math:`B` is much smaller than the number of relations\n",
    "# in the knowledge base.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# .. note::\n",
    "#    Another weight regularization, block-decomposition, is implemented in\n",
    "#    the `link prediction <link-prediction_>`_.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Implement R-GCN in DGL\n",
    "# ----------------------\n",
    "#\n",
    "# An R-GCN model is composed of several R-GCN layers. The first R-GCN layer\n",
    "# also serves as input layer and takes in features (for example, description texts)\n",
    "# that are associated with node entity and project to hidden space. In this tutorial,\n",
    "# we only use the entity ID as an entity feature.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# R-GCN layers\n",
    "# ~~~~~~~~~~~~\n",
    "#\n",
    "# For each node, an R-GCN layer performs the following steps:\n",
    "#\n",
    "# - Compute outgoing message using node representation and weight matrix\n",
    "#   associated with the edge type (message function)\n",
    "# - Aggregate incoming messages and generate new node representations (reduce\n",
    "#   and apply function)\n",
    "#\n",
    "# The following code is the definition of an R-GCN hidden layer.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# .. note::\n",
    "#    Each relation type is associated with a different weight. Therefore,\n",
    "#    the full weight matrix has three dimensions: relation, input_feature,\n",
